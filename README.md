## About The Project

Thoughtstream is a simple and sophisticated diary application that allows users to create and share their diaries. In addition, it has a "Passerby" section where users can post their diary, which are open to all users. However, passers-by can only view the passerby diaries, and they can't comment or connect with the diary owners. The app is designed to be a safe and private space for users to share their thoughts and experiences with others.
